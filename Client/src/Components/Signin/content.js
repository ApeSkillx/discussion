        discussion forum is an online platform to encourage peer to peer interaction in a
group at any time and any location. Users may create a new post, contribute in
ongoing conversations and share information about a particular topic or theme in a
constructive way. Forums provides suitable space for research, gather information
and solve problems. A discussion forum for ICAR scientific community has been
developed to connect scientists working in different institutes. A need was felt to have
a such magnificent communication platform where anyone can contribute their views/
ideas on particular topic of interest. Higher authorities can pass on messages to
members of peer groups across disciplines and subject matter divisions. This powerful
medium will help the authorities to seek suggestions and ideas of group members
(scientists) on a particular topic within a short time.
An attempt has been made to make it a user-friendly software. Most of the screens
and forms are self-explanatory. It has been designed by incorporating general
features of a discussion form for communicating among members. However, some
guidelines are given below explaining its functioning and the rights of specific users
for perforating the message in the community as per hierarchy in the ICAR system.
